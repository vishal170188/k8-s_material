Backup And Restore Etcd In Kubernetes

Etcd is a consistent and highly available key-value store used as Kubernetes’ backing store for all cluster data. If your Kubernetes cluster uses etcd as its backing
store, make sure you have a backup plan for those data. All Kubernetes objects are stored on etcd. Periodically backing up the etcd cluster data is important to 
recover Kubernetes clusters under disaster scenarios, such as losing all control plane nodes. The snapshot file contains all the Kubernetes states and critical 
information. In order to keep the sensitive Kubernetes data safe, encrypt the snapshot files.

Backing up your Kubernetes cluster data by backing up etcd is of crucial importance. etcd is the backend storage solution for the deployed Kubernetes cluster. 
All the K8s objects, applications & configurations are stored in etcd.

Backing up ‘etcd’ data is done using etcd command-line tool: etcdctl

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints $ENDPOINT snapshot save <filename>

Restoring etcd can be done from a backup using the etcdctl snapshot restore command:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore <filename>


The steps are as follows:

1) Execute the etcdctl command to check the Cluster name. Lookup for the cluster.name in the etcd cluster:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get cluster.name \ 
> --endpoints=https://10.0.1.101:2379 \ 
> --cacert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-ca.pem \ 
> --cert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.crt \ 
> --key=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.key

The returned value for the Cluster.name is beebox
What does each mean:

endpoint -> instructing etcdctl how to reach out to etcd serve
cacert -> public certificate for certificate authority
cert -> the client certificate
key -> certificate key

2) Snapshot save will save the backup with the name supplied as an argument:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save /home/cloud_user/etcd_backup.db \ 
> --endpoints=https://10.0.1.101:2379 \ 
> --cacert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-ca.pem \ 
> --cert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.crt \ 
> --key=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.key

3) Now, stop etcd, Delete etcd data dir. Reset etcd by removing all the existing etcd data:


4) Snapshot restore on the etcd data will restore the data back as a temporary etcd cluster. This command will spinup a temp etcd cluster, saving the data from the 
backup file to a new data dir in the same location where the previous data dir was:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --data-dir=/home/labsuser --endpoints=https://172.31.15.140:2379 --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key  snapshot restore etcd_backup.db

5) update hostPath in etcd.yaml with data dir i.e /home/labsuser
